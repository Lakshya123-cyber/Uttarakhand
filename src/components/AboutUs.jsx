      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        Our story began in the nineties! The Uttarakhand community in Singapore
        constituted of a small group of families who had migrated to Singapore
        following work opportunities. As more families came to Singapore and the
        unique surnames from Uttrakhand started appearing in offices and
        organisations, the group members would organically connect and extend a
        warm welcome with a potluck or a simple barbeque in the park, to help
        create a sense of support. Tied together with the common threads of
        cuisine, music, celebrations and the longing to hold on to our roots,
        the group members met every now and then and created informal channels
        to connect and help each other.
        <br />
        <br /> The idea of the Uttarakhand Association of Singapore came into
        being in 2013 when the aftermath of the Uttarakhand Tsunami spurred a
        collective sense of grief and the need to create a space that could hold
        us in togetherness. Whilst we collected funds for the victims of the
        people affected, it was the commonality of the cause and the need for
        connection that inspired us to create a formal organisation that not
        only honoured our roots but also supported our present and future in
        Singapore.
      </p>

      <h1>Our Values</h1>
      <p>
        The UASG was officially registered in 2014 with 25 families as official
        members. Since then, our numbers have grown and it is with a great sense
        of pride that we reflect back on our journey thus far.
        <br />
        <br /> Our association has been involved in celebrations, charities,
        wellness workshops, entrepreneurship programmes as well as promoting our
        culture within and beyond Singapore. We are committed to the social
        cause of bringing our community together and building experiences and
        memories that help us celebrate our traditions and also pass on our
        cultural richness to our next generation. At the same time the UASG is
        also committed to honouring Singapore and support the nation building by
        offering our unique talents and skills to the extended community, be it
        through cultural connections or volunteerism.

      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        The Uttarakhand Association of Singapore (UASG) aims to create a strong
        and united community by valuing our cultural identities through the
        promotion and celebration of Uttarakhand culture and heritage. We strive
        to facilitate connections and nurturing relationships among Uttarakhandi
        families in Singapore, fostering a sense of belonging.
        <br />
        <br /> Additionally, we actively promote Uttarakhandi talents and
        businesses by creating opportunities through socio-cultural events. UASG
        is committed to supporting Uttarakhandi families in need and also works
        towards building connections within the wider Singapore community,
        promoting diversity and harmony.
        <br />
        <br /> Lastly, we extend our support to the local community through
        volunteerism and fundraising initiatives, contributing positively to
        society.
